        <h1>British Airways launches new <span class="adjective">short-haul</span> airline at Gatwick to rival easyJet that will start serving 35 holiday destinations from March next year</h1>
        <p>British Airways has launched a new short-haul airline that will fly from <span class="noun">Gatwick</span> Airport to 35 holiday destinations from March next year.</p>

        <p>The subsidiary airline will operate under the British Airways name, but will exist as an 'entirely separate entity', the firm said.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of its short-haul <span class="noun">flights</span> from Gatwick have been <span class="verb">suspended</span> since the beginning of the Covid pandemic in March last year.</p>

        <p>However, the airline has long <span class="verb">struggled</span> to make its flights from the airport profitable, even prior to the <span class="noun">pandemic</span>, and said it would only resume if there was 'a competitive and sustainable operating cost base'.</p>

        <p>A total of 35 <span class="adjective">short-haul</span> destinations will be served, including Athens, Berlin, Faro, Ibiza, Madrid, Malaga, Marrakech, Milan Malpensa, Santorini and Tenerife.</p>
